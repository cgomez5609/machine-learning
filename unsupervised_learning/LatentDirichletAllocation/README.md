<h1>Latent Dirichlet Allocation</h1>

This is a project to develop Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) from scratch using pure Python. LDA
is topic modeling algorithm used to assign documents to specific topics. It falls under unsupervised
learning in ML. Typically LDA works best when the documents are long, however other topic modeling algorithms  have been
developed that use Gibbs sampling for short text.

<h2>Installation</h2>

cd to the directory that contains the requirements.txt, activate a virtual environment and run the following in your terminal or command prompt.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: I used Python 3.8.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Simply run the main method to see the results. I used Sklearns 20newsgroup dataset as a test.
